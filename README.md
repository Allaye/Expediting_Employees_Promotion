# Project Title:
**Expediting Employees Promotion**

This project was developed to tackle the long delays in promoting a qualified employee to a managerial position and below. 
Currently, the process an employee goes through to get promoted to his/her new role leads to a delay in the transition process. 
Our task was to analyze the data and develop an accurate model to help the organization fast track its promotion cycle. 
The project made use of a machine learning framework that goes through the features for the promotion of an employee. 
Using the binary logistic regression, the model is able to predict whether an employee is promoted or not.


# Demo

A demo has been created to show you how the model works.
We have created an interface where you can interact with the model in making prediction.
This shows how the model was deployed in Microsoft Azure and using Microsoft Azure Web App to develop an app for users to interact with it

## Hardware: 
The following specs were used to create the original solution;

The requirements:

•	Any Standard Personal Computer will do 

## Software 
The following python packages were used in the original solution; 

The requirements:

•	Python 3.7

•	Flask Web Framework

•	Azure Web service

•	HTML, CSS and Bootstrap4

## Data Setup

Dataset

The dataset was obtained from the company. 
The training database contains 54,808 observation and 14 columns. 
The training database contained missing data in two columns which were education and previous_year_rating. 
It is a good database for people who want to try machine learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
The dataset contains various categorical variables which was converted using one-hot encoding. For the labelled data, it has already been converted into a nominal variable.
The employee ID gave a distinct dataset making it impossible to get a duplicated observation. 


## Data Processing:


## Model Build:
These are the options used to produce the solution.

After the dataset was cleaned, it was divided into a train and test set. Machine learning model, binary logistic regression model was used in training the dataset. 
The accuracy score from the model gave a very low F1 score and recall score. This was due to the data imbalance in the labelled value.
